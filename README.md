# Amino-Acid-Classification
For my final project in Stat 441 at the University of Waterloo I was given a large dataset corresponding to amino acid residues. The goal of the project is to classify the compatibility of each amino acid residue in the sample with its optimal position in the correctly folded protein structure.
